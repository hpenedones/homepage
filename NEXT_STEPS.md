# Blogspot Import - Next Steps

## What's Been Done

✅ Created year-based directory structure (2008/, 2009/, 2010/, 2012/, 2013/)
✅ Created Python import script (`blog/import_from_blogspot.py`)
✅ Updated blog structure to support year-based organization
✅ Added comprehensive documentation (IMPORT_GUIDE.md, updated README.md)
✅ Added sample imported post to demonstrate the structure
✅ Updated blog/index.html to handle year-based file paths

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run the Import Script

Since the import script requires internet access to fetch posts from Blogspot, you'll need to run it on your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/hpenedones/homepage.git
cd homepage/blog

# Run the import script
python3 import_from_blogspot.py
```

The script will:
- Fetch all ~44 posts from aboutintelligence.blogspot.com
- Convert them from HTML to Markdown
- Save them in year-based directories (2008/, 2009/, 2010/, 2012/, 2013/)
- Generate a `posts_array.js` file with the posts array for index.html

### Step 2: Update index.html

After the script completes:

1. Open `blog/posts_array.js` (generated by the script)
2. Copy the entire `posts` array (including the `const posts = [...]` line)
3. Open `blog/index.html`
4. Replace the existing `posts` array (around line 37-43) with the copied content
5. Save the file

### Step 3: Review and Commit

1. Review the imported markdown files to ensure they look good
2. Test the blog locally by opening `blog/index.html` in a browser
3. Commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add blog/
git commit -m "Import blog posts from Blogspot"
git push
```

### Step 4: Deploy

Once pushed, your blog will be live on GitHub Pages with all your old Blogspot posts organized by year!

## Expected Results

According to the Blogspot archive, you should see:
- **2008**: ~20 posts
- **2009**: ~17 posts
- **2010**: ~4 posts
- **2012**: ~2 posts
- **2013**: ~1 post
- **Total**: ~44 posts

## Troubleshooting

### Can't access Blogspot?
If the script fails to connect to Blogspot:
- Check your internet connection
- Try running from a different network
- Verify aboutintelligence.blogspot.com is accessible in your browser

### Posts look weird?
The HTML-to-Markdown conversion is automated and may not be perfect for complex layouts:
- Review the markdown files
- Manually edit any posts that need formatting fixes
- The original Blogspot URL is included in each post for reference

### Need to re-run?
The script is idempotent - you can run it multiple times. It will overwrite existing files.
