        <h3>About me</h3>

<p>I am a Software Engineer with research experience in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. On my free time I like to travel, play football and learn capoeira, among other things.</p>
<p>Things I value: win-win solutions, simplicity, beauty, honesty, kindness, pragmatism, diversity, efficiency.</p>
<p>Things I don't like: software bloat (hurts my stomach), unreliable technology (gets on my nerves), owning too many objects (find it tiring), dogmatic beliefs (makes constructive dialogues hard), people that exploit others (no comments).</p>

<h3>Book</h3>

<p>
    In 2011, I wrote a <a href="http://www.anossavez.net">book</a> in Portuguese, expressing my views of the world. In a collection of very small chapters, I touch a wide range of topics, such as: democracy, economy, education, entrepreneurship, transparency, sustainability, peace, etc.</p>
    <p> I try to convey an optimistic message, which I find very lacking these days, specially in Portugal. The title, "A nossa vez" (in English, "Our turn"), and the cover page, quickly convey the book's main message: it's now up to our generation to make the fundamental changes that the Portuguese society needs. The previous generations did it gracefully in 1974. Now it's our turn. We have unique conditions to do it peacefully, smoothly and restricting ourselves to win-win solutions.
    <p> If you are interested, you can read the full book in digital formats for free, or order a paperback copy.</p>
