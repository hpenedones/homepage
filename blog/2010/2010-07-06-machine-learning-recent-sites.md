In the last few months (in which I haven't posted in this blog) there were a few interesting web platforms related to Machine Learning poping-up, most notably:  
MLcomp.org - you can upload your datasets and/or your algorithms, and experiments will run automatically. Then you can see statistics related to classifier performances and computation times. It is intended to help researchers and practitioners comparing different methods, and it works as a collaborative platform where code and data can be shared.  
MetaOptimize.com - it contains a great QA about Machine Learning and related topics, using the same web platform [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) has for programming topics.   
I find these two websites a great way to improve collaboration among the ML community. Highly recommended!  
The latest link is more market oriented, and it comes from Google:  
Google Predict API: it puts together well established ML algorithms in an API that developers can use to make predictions on their own datasets.
