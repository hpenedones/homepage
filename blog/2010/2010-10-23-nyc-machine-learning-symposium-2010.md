The [event](http://www.nyas.org/events/Detail.aspx?cid=1cdd40d6-fc64-44e8-b225-db49ac0d90f1) took place yesterday at the New York Academy of Sciences, a building right next to the World Trade Center. The views from the 40th floor were breathtaking:

The names of the participants in the room was no less impressive, (by no special order): Corinna Cortes (Google), Rob Schapire and David Blei (Princeton University), John Langford and Alex Smola (Yahoo), Yann LeCun (NYU), Sanjoy Dasgupta (Univ. California), Michael Collins (MIT), Patrick Haffner (AT&T), among many others.
I particularly liked to see the latest developments in LeCun's group, including a demo by Benoit Corda and Clément Farabet on speeding-up Convolutional Neural Networks with GPUs and FPGAs. Alex Kulezka and Ben Taskar had a nice work on ["Structured Determinantal Point Processes"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2010/file/1f50893f80d6830d62765ffad7721742-Paper.pdf), which can be seen as a probabilistic model with a bias towards diversity of the hidden structures. Mathew Hoffman (with D. Blei and F. Bach) used stochastic gradient descent (widely used among neural network community) for [online training of topic models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2010/file/71f6278d140af599e06ad9bf1ba03cb0-Paper.pdf). Sean Gerrish and D. Blei actually had a funny application of topic models to the [prediction of votes by Senators](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/GerrishBlei2011.pdf)!I was also happy to see that there is some Machine Learning being applied to the problem of sustainability and the environment. Gregory Moore and Charles Bergeron had a poster on trash detection in lakes, rivers and oceans. To conclude, the best student paper award went to a more theoretical paper by Kareem Amin, Michael Kearns and Umar Syed (U Penn) called ["Bandits, Query Learning, and the Haystack Dimension"](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/haystack.pdf), which defines a measure of complexity for multi-armed bandit problems in which the number of actions can be infinite (there is some analogy to the role of VC-dimension in other learning models).  
There were probably many other interesting posters worth being mentioned, but I didn't have the chance to check them all!  
On the personal side: my summer internship at NEC Labs with David Grangier is about to finish. It was an amazing learning experience and I am very grateful for it. Next step: back to Idiap Research Institute, EPFL and all the Swiss lakes and mountains! :)
