I have recently started working as a Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](http://www.deepmind.com/), in London. It's very exciting to be surrounded by some of the best researchers in Machine Learning in the world, with such an ambitious mission statement and the right conditions to pursue it. I will be working in Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning real world applications with positive impact in society.
