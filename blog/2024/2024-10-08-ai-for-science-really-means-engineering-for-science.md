Indeed! 😊 Glad to have been one of those Research Engineers working in the beginning of AlphaFold,
alongside Marek Barwinski, Richard Evans, Laurent Sifre, James Kirkpatrick and Andrew Senior. Steve
Crossan got the AlphaFold project officially started, after the initial Hackathon results, in early
2016. We had help from other engineers, such as Vedavyas Panneershelvam, for things like using the
Rosetta library at Google, compile it with blaze, etc. We had to set up part of the infrastructure in
Google cloud, write python wrappers, write a leaderboard with automated metrics, etc. Lots of "boring"
engineering work. The foundation for later successes.

Now at [Inductiva.AI](https://inductiva.ai) we noticed the same pattern: we envision a world where
physics simulations will merge with Machine Learning, but there is a *lot* of infrastructure work that
needs to be done first, and that's mostly software engineering. Our API will lower the barrier of
entry for scientists and engineers to generate large Physics datasets to train ML models in different
fields (fluids, molecules, materials, etc). Doing the "boring" work first. ;)

This was a reaction to Steve Crossan's article [Engineering for Science](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engineering-science-steve-crossan-me1be),
written the day before the announcement of the Nobel Prize for AlphaFold - little did he know!
