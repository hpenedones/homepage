Agreed. That's why in most other problems in science and engineering, we will need to generate high
quality synthetic data using numerical simulators where the rules of Physics are programmed explicitly.
You can use them to generate big datasets, with perfect annotations for supervised learning (think:
fluid dynamics where you know the velocities at every point in space and time).

That's what we are building at [Inductiva.AI](https://inductiva.ai): a platform that makes it much
easier to generate physics/chemistry/biology datasets. If you are an engineer, e.g. in coastal
dynamics, you can also use it to explore many parameters and run many simulations in parallel for
those (no need to run ML on top afterwards, but you can!).
