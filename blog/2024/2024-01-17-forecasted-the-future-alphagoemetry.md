Forecasted the future 2 days ahead, not bad! Without inside info, despite having worked at DeepMind
in the past. :)

Two days ago I gave a talk at the Math department of Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da
Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, where in the last slide I made a prediction:

In 2024 we would see a breakthrough in LLMs for Math and it would probably involve:

- merging search with LLMs, much like System 1 and System 2 in "Thinking Fast and Slow" and AlphaGo
- solving International Math Olympiads problems at a level similar to the best competitors

See a screenshot of my last slides.

Well, here is [AlphaGeometry by Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/) (congrats!).
