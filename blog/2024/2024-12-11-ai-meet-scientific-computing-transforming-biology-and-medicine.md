# AI Meet Scientific Computing: Transforming Biology and Medicine

**Date:** December 11, 2024

---

I was invited as the **keynote speaker** at the *Dia da Investigação* (Research Day) organised by the
[Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa](https://www.medicina.ulisboa.pt), held at
the Auditório Professor David Ferreira (A52), Edifício Egas Moniz, at 13h.

The talk was titled **"AI Meet Scientific Computing: Transforming Biology and Medicine"** and covered
the intersection of artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and their transformative impact on
biology and medicine - with a particular focus on how AI is reshaping drug discovery, protein structure
prediction, and life sciences research.

## Context

This talk came in the wake of the [2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/summary/)
being awarded to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for AlphaFold - an AI model that solved the 50-year-old
protein structure prediction problem. I was one of the early contributors to the AlphaFold project at
Google DeepMind, and it was a wonderful opportunity to share that journey with a medical audience and
discuss the broader implications for biology and medicine.

Key themes covered in the talk:

- How the [2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognised AlphaFold](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_breaking-news-the-royal-swedish-academy-of-activity-7249723302561075200-cxfx)
  as a breakthrough in computational biology
- Why [AI for Science really means Engineering for Science](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_ai-for-science-really-means-engineering-for-activity-7249524919896555522-tLEC) -
  the often-overlooked infrastructure work that makes breakthroughs possible
- How [a data bottleneck is holding AI science back](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_a-data-bottleneck-is-holding-ai-science-activity-7251910700980195328-T682),
  and why numerical simulation is key to overcoming it
- The work at [Inductiva.AI](https://inductiva.ai) to democratise physics simulation and dataset generation for science and engineering

Earlier that month I gave [a related talk at the Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto (FCUP)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_hoje-%C3%A0s-1730-na-faculdade-de-ci%C3%AAncias-da-activity-7254457845939589120-Hc5z)
on the Machine Learning contributions to the 2024 Nobel Prizes. The Lisbon talk went deeper into the
medical and biological implications for a medical research audience.

The event was organised by the Faculdade de Medicina, [CAML](https://caml.medicina.ulisboa.pt/), GAPIC,
and AEFML (the student association of the Faculty of Medicine of Lisbon).
