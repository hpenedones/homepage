# AI Meet Scientific Computing: Transforming Biology and Medicine

**Date:** December 11, 2024

---

I was invited as the **keynote speaker** at the *Dia da Investigação* (Research Day) organised by the
[Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa](https://www.medicina.ulisboa.pt), held at
the Auditório Professor David Ferreira (A52), Edifício Egas Moniz, at 13h.

The talk was titled **"AI Meet Scientific Computing: Transforming Biology and Medicine"** and covered
the intersection of artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and their transformative impact on
biology and medicine - with a particular focus on how AI is reshaping drug discovery, protein structure
prediction, and life sciences research.

## Context

This talk came in the wake of the [2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/summary/)
being awarded to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper for AlphaFold - an AI model that solved the 50-year-old
protein structure prediction problem. I was one of the early contributors to the AlphaFold project at
Google DeepMind, and it was a wonderful opportunity to share that journey with a medical audience and
discuss the broader implications for biology and medicine.

Key themes covered in the talk:

- How the [2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry recognised AlphaFold](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_breaking-news-the-royal-swedish-academy-of-activity-7249723302561075200-cxfx)
  as a breakthrough in computational biology
- Why [AI for Science really means Engineering for Science](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_ai-for-science-really-means-engineering-for-activity-7249524919896555522-tLEC) -
  the often-overlooked infrastructure work that makes breakthroughs possible
- How [a data bottleneck is holding AI science back](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_a-data-bottleneck-is-holding-ai-science-activity-7251910700980195328-T682),
  and why numerical simulation is key to overcoming it
- The work at [Inductiva.AI](https://inductiva.ai) to democratise physics simulation and dataset generation for science and engineering
- The [debate around Artificial General Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-activity-7117572216531144704-71sN)
  and how modern AI systems are already exhibiting AGI-like breadth of knowledge

## Background

The story of AlphaFold goes back to 2016, but there were important milestones along the way.
In September 2023, [the AlphaFold team won the prestigious Lasker Award](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_team-behind-ai-program-alphafold-win-lasker-activity-7110655692708929537-V4Ng)
- a major recognition in biomedical research, well before the Nobel Prize was announced.

In January 2024, I [predicted that training data from molecular dynamics simulations would be key](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_ai-driven-drug-discovery-is-poised-to-boom-activity-7150454306922569728-0B1q)
to the next wave of AI-driven drug discovery. Drug design goes beyond protein structure prediction -
it requires modelling protein-ligand interactions, binding pockets, conformational changes and binding
affinities, all of which demand synthetic data at scale that only simulation can provide. This prediction
became a central thread of the keynote.

Also in January 2024, I gave [a talk at the Mathematics department of Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade NOVA de Lisboa](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_forecasted-the-future-2-days-ahead-not-bad-activity-7153453226351116288-vjvU),
where I predicted we would see a breakthrough in LLMs for mathematics in 2024 - involving the merging
of search with LLMs, similar to AlphaGo. Two days later, Google DeepMind announced AlphaGeometry,
vindicating the prediction.

In May 2024, in a lighter moment, I noticed that [Jürgen Schmidhuber cited our 2019 NeurIPS paper on
Adaptive Temporal-Difference Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_that-feeling-when-schmidhuber-cites-your-activity-7195052610528149504-58pu)
- a paper on uncertainty-aware RL that didn't catch much attention at the time.

Earlier in December 2024, I gave [a related talk at the Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto (FCUP)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hpenedones_hoje-%C3%A0s-1730-na-faculdade-de-ci%C3%AAncias-da-activity-7254457845939589120-Hc5z)
on the Machine Learning contributions to the 2024 Nobel Prizes. The Lisbon keynote went deeper into the
medical and biological implications for a medical research audience.

The event was organised by the Faculdade de Medicina, [CAML](https://caml.medicina.ulisboa.pt/), GAPIC,
and AEFML (the student association of the Faculty of Medicine of Lisbon).
