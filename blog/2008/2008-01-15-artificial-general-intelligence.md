Back in 1956, the founders of the new AI research field (John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell and Hebert Simon) were deeply convinced that in a period of one generation we would have human-level intelligent computers.  
However, after more than 50 years, we are still not able to solve some tasks that humans do without any apparent effort (such as distinguishing a dog from a cat or a horse in any kind of picture). Many frustrating results mark the history of AI: low quality of (early) machine translation systems, lack of robustness of speech recognition and computer vision systems, etc.  
The so called "AI winter" is generally perceived to be finished by now, since many researchers have new hopes on building Artificial General Intelligence. Recent contributions from both neuroscience and theoretical computer science were decisive to create this optimism.  
Here is a book edited by Ben Goertzel and Cassio Pennachin putting together several of the different renewed ideas.

As I read it, I will post comments on individual chapters concerning different approaches to AGI.
