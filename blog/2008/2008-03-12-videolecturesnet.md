A fast recommendation to the people interested in assisting to video talks in their computers:  

[http://www.videolectures.net](http://www.videolectures.net/)  

The website is specially interesting for the Machine Learning community, given that it has currently almost 600 videos on the topic, however you may find many other nice subjects. In fact if you work on Machine Learning, most likely I am not telling you anything new. In this case you could perhaps post a comment pointing to a video lecture that you found specially relevant. Thanks!
