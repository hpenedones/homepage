If everything goes as planned this year I am attending two Summer Schools.  

The first one, the [International Computer Vision Summer School 2008 ](https://web.archive.org/web/http://svg.dmi.unict.it/icvss2008/), will be hosted in Sicily, Italy in 14-19 July. The [program](https://web.archive.org/web/http://svg.dmi.unict.it/icvss2008/speakers&Syllabus.htm) seems to be quite good and it will cover topics like object detection, tracking or 3D reconstruction, among others. There's also a reading group on "[how to conduct a literature review and discover the context of an idea](https://web.archive.org/web/http://svg.dmi.unict.it/icvss2008/Abstracts/SoattoRG.pdf)". The challenge is to see how far back in the past one can track the origins of a scientific idea. For example, the AdaBoost is a well known machine learning meta-algorithm, in which a sequence of classifiers is progressively trained focusing on the instances misclassified by previous classifiers. The set of classifiers is then combined by a weighted average. It was introduced by Freund and Schapire in 1996. This is easy to track, the question however is: can you find the same or similar core idea, or intution, somewhere else back in the past? Possibly from a different domain?  
It's gonna be fun!  

The second one is the [10th Machine Learning Summer School](https://web.archive.org/web/http://mlss08.futurs.inria.fr/), 1-15 September, Ile de Re, France. The [program](https://web.archive.org/web/http://mlss08.futurs.inria.fr/confirmed-lecture-courses) is also quite nice, but I still don't have the confirmation I can attend it.  
I would be specially interested in [Rich Sutton](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Esutton/index.html)'s lecture on *"Reinforcement Learning and Knowledge Representation" *although hearing about Active Learning, Bayesian Learning, Clustering, Kernel Methods, etc. also sounds quite appealing.  

Looking forward to science in summer time!
