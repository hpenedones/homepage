In this 10min [TED](http://www.ted.com/) talk, [Joshua Klein](http://www.wireless.is/projects/crows/) talks about crows and how they are incredibly good learners.  

  

They seem to have a powerful memory, use vision effectively, have problem solving skills, use tools and even learn from examples of other crows. I guess [AGI](http://www.agiri.org/wiki/What_is_AGI) is more than achieved at "crow-level Artificial Intelligence"!!
