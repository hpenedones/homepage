Held in Ile de Ré (France), 1-15th September, this school counted with some famous names within the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence communities: [Rich Sutton](https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/%7Esutton/) (co-author of the widely adopted book on Reinforcement Learning), [Isabelle Guyon](https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.clopinet.com/isabelle/) (co-author of the first paper on Support Vector Machines) and [Yann LeCun](https://web.archive.org/web/http://yann.lecun.com) (known for the convolutional neural network, energy based models and the DjVu image compression technique).  

You can check the (almost) complete list of lecturers [here](https://web.archive.org/web/http://mlss08.futurs.inria.fr/confirmed-lecture-courses). I found the course given by [Shai Ben-David](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Eshai/), on *the Theoretical Foundations of Clustering"* quite interesting and intriguing. Clustering seems to be *really* lacking solid theoretical support, which is surprising, given the importance of the problem. Some [atempts](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/nips15.pdf) are being done to axiomatize it, but there are a lot of [open questions](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Eshai/LuxburgBendavid05.pdf): what exactly is the class of clustering algorithms? how can you compare different clustering algorithms? why is a partition better than other?  
Hope to see more developments in this area in the coming years.
