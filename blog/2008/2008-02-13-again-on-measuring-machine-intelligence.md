I have recently found two tech reports written by Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter (IDSIA, Lugano, Switzerland) in which they make very interesting reviews on the definitions of machine intelligence and ways to measure it.  
Have a look at:

It's a pleasure to see that some people face the fundamental problems of AI from the front!
