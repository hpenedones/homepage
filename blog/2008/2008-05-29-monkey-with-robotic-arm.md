I'm not sure it's recent news, because there is a [public release from as back as 2005](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-02/uopm-bcr021405.php), but I just came across [this video](http://www.publico.clix.pt/videos/?v=20080529161910&z=1) of a monkey eating using a robotic arm directly controlled by his brain. Researchers are from the Pittsburgh University.  

Really impressive, although probably a bit tough for the monkey.
