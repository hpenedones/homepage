I'm not sure it's recent news, because there is a [public release from as back as 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-02/uopm-bcr021405.php), but I just came across this video of a monkey eating using a robotic arm directly controlled by his brain. Researchers are from the Pittsburgh University.

Really impressive, although probably a bit tough for the monkey.
