Yesterday I attended to this workshop at EPFL:

 It was a good opportunity to see old friends and colleagues, and listen about their latest research. In general, the quality of the talks was quite good, ranging from very theoretical machine learning (sparse coding, optimization, etc.) to commercial applications of computer vision ([www.faceshift.com](http://www.faceshift.com/)).  
 Somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, I also quite liked the talk about learning image local descriptors ([BRIEF](http://cvlab.epfl.ch/~trzcinsk/publications/brief_pami.pdf) and [LBGM](http://cvlab.epfl.ch/~trzcinsk/publications/nips12.pdf)) as a compact and efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF, which are hand-designed, slower and use more bits. There were also applications to speech, face analysis and even remote sensing.  

 Have a look at the program and keep an eye on it in the coming days, as the slides will probably become available. You will find several other interesting talks:
