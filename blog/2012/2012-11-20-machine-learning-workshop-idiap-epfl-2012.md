Yesterday I attended to the Machine Learning Workshop at Idiap EPFL.

 It was a good opportunity to see old friends and colleagues, and listen about their latest research. In general, the quality of the talks was quite good, ranging from very theoretical machine learning (sparse coding, optimization, etc.) to commercial applications of computer vision ([www.faceshift.com](http://www.faceshift.com/)).  
 Somewhere in the middle of that spectrum, I also quite liked the talk about learning image local descriptors (BRIEF and LBGM) as a compact and efficient alternative to SIFT or SURF, which are hand-designed, slower and use more bits. There were also applications to speech, face analysis and even remote sensing.
