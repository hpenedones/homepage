I tend to agree. AI systems used to perform better than humans on some specific narrow tasks (e.g.
chess). But they couldn't do anything else.

Now the situation is reversed: you can still find human experts that give better answers than ChatGPT
in each specific subfield, but no single human can give good answers on such a wide range of topics
(and communicate in so many different languages) - if that person existed, they would be considered a
genius with an unprecedented level of knowledge.
