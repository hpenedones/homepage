I tend to agree with Blaise Aguera y Arcas and Peter Norvig, who argue in their Noema Magazine article
["Artificial General Intelligence Is Already Here"](https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/)
that today's most advanced AI models should already be recognised as the first true examples of AGI.

Their key insight: AI systems used to perform better than humans on some specific narrow tasks (e.g.
chess). But they couldn't do anything else.

Now the situation is reversed: you can still find human experts that give better answers than ChatGPT
in each specific subfield, but no single human can give good answers on such a wide range of topics
(and communicate in so many different languages) - if that person existed, they would be considered a
genius with an unprecedented level of knowledge.
