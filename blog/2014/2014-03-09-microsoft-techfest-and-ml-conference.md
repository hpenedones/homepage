Ten years after my Summer internship at Microsoft as an undergraduate student, I had the opportunity to be back to the Redmond campus. This time the goal was to attend Microsoft Research's techfest and participate in the Practice of Machine Learning conference. I can't share much about what I saw there, but I must say I was impressed by the amount of great talks and cool demos. MSR is really a leading research institution and lots of theory and cutting-edge applications keep on emerging, most notably in many Bing products. It's great to be part of this community.
It was also a good occasion to see some old friends, which made my stay even richer.
Looking forward to be back!
