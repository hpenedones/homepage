Just a short link to an [article of the New York Times about AI](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/science/08sail.html?_r=1).  

In 1978, Dr. McCarthy wrote, “human-level A.I. might require 1.7 Einsteins, 2 Maxwells, 5 Faradays and .3 Manhattan Projects.”  

I think we probably have the genius scientists around, but not so sure about the 0.3 Manhattan Projects!
