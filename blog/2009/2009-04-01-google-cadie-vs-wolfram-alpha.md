[Google already has a tradition of April fool's jokes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_hoaxes): this year they are introducing an Artificial Intelligence brain!  

They describe the development process of their so called [CADIE : Cognitive Autoheuristic Distributed-Intelligence Entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_April_Fools%27_Day_jokes#2009) like this:  

"For several years now a small research group has been working on some challenging problems in the areas of neural networking, natural language and autonomous problem-solving. Last fall this group achieved a significant breakthrough: a powerful new technique for solving reinforcement learning problems, resulting in the first functional global-scale neuro-evolutionary learning cluster."  

Remember, this is an April fool's hoax. But now compare it with Wolfram's [announcement](http://blog.wolfram.com/2009/03/05/wolframalpha-is-coming/) of the new Wolfram Alpha:  

"I wasn’t at all sure it was going to work. But I’m happy to say that with a mixture of many clever algorithms and heuristics, lots of linguistic discovery and linguistic curation, and what probably amount to some serious theoretical breakthroughs, we’re actually managing to make it work."  

I find them quite similar! ;)  

Now more seriously: I don't doubt Wolfram Alpha will have interesting features, but please don't try to sell it like the ultimate AI search engine. By the way, Daniel Tunkelang has a [recent and well informed post on this topic](http://thenoisychannel.com/2009/03/31/wolfram-alpha-first-hand-impressions/).  

Update: Indeed this [sneak preview of Wolfram Alpha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYhLsQPHNas) shows some cool features! In the meanwhile [Google also gave some steps in the direction of better public data/statistics visualization](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qt2n34VEr4).
