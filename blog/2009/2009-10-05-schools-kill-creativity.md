My good friend Miguel called my attention to a TED talk that you might also find interesting:

Ken Robinson argues that "schools kill creativity", because kids are not given the chance to discover their interests and talents. Since very soon, students get a negative reward for making mistakes, which makes them too risk averse. He goes further, saying that the educational system is built to create university professors, leaving the majority of the students behing along the way. More space should be given to other forms of expressing intelligence, such as the arts or sports.
I strongly recommend this video. Besides the interest of the subject, the presentation is actually quite funny, it somehow resembles a British-style stand-up comedy!
