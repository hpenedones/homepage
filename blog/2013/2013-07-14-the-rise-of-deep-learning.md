# The rise of Deep Learning

**Date:** July 14, 2013

A couple of years ago, I was doing research involving Convolutional Neural Networks for object classification tasks (see [here](http://hpenedones.org/publications/Penedones_Idiap-RR-30-2012.pdf)). At that point, deep learning was an (re)emergent field, but it hadn't achieved mainstream yet.

Today, several factors are contributing to the increase of visibility:

1. Announcements of great results in Kaggle competitions and commercial applications, such as [Google's improved photo search](http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/improving-photo-search-step-across.html) and [Microsoft's fast and robust speech recognition system](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57589465-75/microsoft-revs-speedier-smarter-speech-recognition-for-phones/).
2. Online courses, such as [Geoffrey Hinton's "Neural Networks for Machine Learning" in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks).
3. Greater variety of software implementations, including many that use the power of GPU parallelism.

What will be the next milestones?
