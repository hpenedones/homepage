I recently made public more of my programming projects from the past. My github profile now includes:

- [luacnn](https://github.com/hpenedones/luacnn) - Convolutional Neural Network for hand digit recognition using Torch7 and Lua.
- [metrics](https://github.com/hpenedones/metrics) - a Torch7 package to compute some metrics, such as area under ROC.
- [lakeml](https://github.com/hpenedones/lakeml) - some Machine Learning algorithms implemented in C++, e.g. AdaBoost, K-means, EM for (diagonal) Gaussian Mixture Models.
- [partitracker](https://github.com/hpenedones/partitracker) - a simple Particle Filter implemented in C++ and OpenCV.
- [sudoku](https://github.com/hpenedones/sudoku) - a Sudoku puzzle solver in pure C.
- [kdtree](https://github.com/hpenedones/kdtree) - a K-d tree C++ implementation, for Nearest Neighbours search.
- [likewise](https://github.com/hpenedones/likewise) - a simple Python webserver for image similarity search, using the embeddings from a pre-trained convnet.
- [fractals](https://github.com/hpenedones/fractals) - Zoomable Mandelbrot fractal renderings using PyGame.
- [acm_utils](https://github.com/hpenedones/acm_utils) - Data structures and algorithms useful for programming competitions (trie, balanced tree, big ints, suffix arrays, etc.) and other small C or C++ pearls.
