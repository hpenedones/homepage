# Importing Blog Posts from Blogspot

This directory contains a script to import blog posts from your old Blogspot blog (aboutintelligence.blogspot.com) to this repository.

## Quick Start

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Run the import script:
   ```bash
   cd blog
   python3 import_from_blogspot.py
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Fetch all posts from aboutintelligence.blogspot.com
   - Convert HTML content to Markdown
   - Organize posts by year (2008/, 2009/, 2010/, 2012/, 2013/)
   - Generate a JavaScript array for `index.html`

4. After the script completes:
   - Open `blog/posts_array.js`
   - Copy the entire `posts` array
   - Replace the `posts` array in `blog/index.html` (around line 38)

5. Commit and push your changes

## Directory Structure

After import, your blog directory will look like this:

```
blog/
├── 2008/
│   ├── 2008-05-31-post-title.md
│   └── ...
├── 2009/
│   ├── 2009-01-15-post-title.md
│   └── ...
├── 2010/
│   └── ...
├── 2012/
│   └── ...
├── 2013/
│   └── ...
├── index.html
├── post.html
├── posts_array.js  (generated by script)
└── import_from_blogspot.py
```

## What Gets Imported

According to the Blogspot archive:
- **2008**: ~20 posts
- **2009**: ~17 posts
- **2010**: ~4 posts
- **2012**: ~2 posts
- **2013**: ~1 post
- **Total**: ~44 posts

## Post Format

Each imported post will have:
- Title as H1
- Publication date
- Link to original Blogspot post
- Content converted from HTML to Markdown

Example:
```markdown
# Post Title

**Date:** May 31, 2008

**Original URL:** https://aboutintelligence.blogspot.com/2008/05/post-title.html

---

Post content in Markdown format...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script fails to connect
- Check your internet connection
- Verify that aboutintelligence.blogspot.com is accessible
- Try running the script again

### Some posts are missing content
- The script converts HTML to Markdown using a simple parser
- Complex HTML structures might not convert perfectly
- You can manually edit the markdown files if needed

### Character encoding issues
- The script uses UTF-8 encoding
- Most special characters should be preserved
- If you see strange characters, check the original post

## Manual Import

If the automated script doesn't work, you can manually:
1. Visit https://aboutintelligence.blogspot.com/
2. Navigate to each post
3. Copy the content
4. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate year directory
5. Format as shown in the example above
6. Add the post to the `posts` array in `index.html`

## Notes

- The script preserves links, images, formatting, and code blocks
- Original Blogspot URLs are included for reference
- Posts are organized by year for easy navigation
- The `posts` array in `index.html` is sorted newest first for display
